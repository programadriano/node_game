# Guessing number
 
This is a simple guessing game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. This project includes a Jest test suite to ensure that the game works as expected.

## Installation
To use this project, you will need Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Clone the repository and install the necessary packages using the following commands:

```bash
npm install
```

# Usage
To start the game, run the following command in the project directory:

```
node index.js
```

You will be prompted to enter a number between 1 and 100. Keep guessing until you correctly guess the secret number!

# Testing
To run the test suite, use the following command:

```bash
npm test 
```

The test suite uses Jest to test the functionality of the game. 

The tests ensure that the game correctly handles invalid input, generates a random number between 1 and 100, and correctly identifies when the player has guessed the secret number.
